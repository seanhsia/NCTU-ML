---
- This is the repository storing homework and project of NCTU machine learning course


## HW1
---
- There are two tasks contain in this directory:
    ### 1. Iris
        Desicion tree and implemented random forest are used to classify iris dataset.
    ### 2. Google Play Store Data 
        Desicion tree and implemented random forest are used to predict number of downloads.
        
- There are more details contained in **HW1_report.pdf**

## HW2
---
- There are two implementation codes in this directory
    ### 1. K-means
        Shannon entropy is used to measure the performace of our implementation
    ### 2. KD tree

- There are more details contained in **HW2_report.pdf**
    
## HW3
---
- Regression models and gradient descent are implemented in this homework
- Mean Square Error is used as the loss function
- Adam and SGD are implemented
- There are more details contained in **Report.pdf**


## HW4/MLHW4
---
- Implement Gradient descent applying on multilayer perceptron using numpy.
- There are more details contained in **0616023.pdf**

## Project
---
- Try to classify which band the song or the character  belongs to using several handcrafted features
- **PCA** is applied to reduce the dimensions of feature space
- Decision tree, random forest, k-NN and SVM are used to solved such problem
- There are more details contained in **Team36.pdf** and **Report_ppt.pdf**
